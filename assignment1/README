1.How to compile:
Under the homework folder, type:

  $ make

to compile the source code.

2.How to run the program
There will be 2 programs generated after running the makefile: client_1 and server_1.
Under the homework folder, run the program by following command:

  $ ./server_1 <PORT_NUMBER>

to start the server, and then run:

  $ ./client_1 <PORT_NUMBER>

to start the client.

the client will ask the user provide some input to send the requests.
1. user's client id: please input a int from 0 - 255
2. If user want to modify the packets.
  If no, then client will sent 5 correct packages and they will get acknowledge responses from server.
  If yes, client ask user which package and which fields user want to modify.

  a. To reproduce the out of sequence error, we can edit the second package sequence number from 2 to 3 or any larger number.
  b. To reproduce the length field not match error, simply edit any package's length field to any other value.
  c. To reproduce end of package missing error, choose editing any packets's the end_identifier feild, (note: the client won't ask user for any value for end_id, but edit the end_id directly to 0XFFF0 mentioned in document.)
  d. To reproduce the duplicated sequence error, similar with (option a), edit third package from 3 to 2 or any equivalent change.
